##A. Deliverables:
###README.md
 - Describes the repository content and describes how the script works
 
###CodeBook.md
 - Describes the variables, the data, and transformations performed to clean up the data for this course project
 
###run_analysis.R
 - R code for all the cleansing and trasformation work
 
###tidydata.txt
 - Output for this course project

##B. How the script works:
In run_analysis.R, first it read all data sets and store into variables

 - trainData: Training set
 - trainLabel: Training label
 - trainSubject: Training subject
 - testData: Testing set
 - testLabel: Testing label
 - testSubject: Testing subject
 - features: List of all features
 - activity: Class labels with activity name

step 1 Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set

 - data.train: Combine all train data - trainData, trainLabel, trainSubject
 - data.test: Combine all test data - testData, testLabel, testSubject
 - data.all: Combine data.train, data.test

Step 2 Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement

 - cols: Read the columns that has mean or standard deviation in measurement
 - data.mean_std: Subset data.all, and only keep columns defined in cols

Step 3 Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

 - colname: Uses activity name as column name for data.mean_std

Step 4 Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names

 - data.merge: Merge data.mean_std and activity by 'ActivityName'

Step 5 Creates a second, independent tidy data set

 - tidydata: Use data.table package to process data.merge, calculate the average of each variable for each activity and each subject, and write it into text file
